//MARK: Integers

/* Integers are whole number without fraction like 20 and -20
 it could be either positive or negative*/

/*
 In most cases, we don’t need to pick a specific size of integer to use in our code.
 Swift provides an additional integer type, Int, which has the same size as the current platform’s native word size:
 
 - On a 32-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int32.
 - On a 64-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int64.
 
 */

/*
 UInt
 Swift also provides an unsigned integer type, UInt, which has the same size as the current platform’s native word size:

 - On a 32-bit platform, UInt is the same size as UInt32.
 - On a 64-bit platform, UInt is the same size as UInt64.

let number = 1234 // Integer without fraction value
print(number)

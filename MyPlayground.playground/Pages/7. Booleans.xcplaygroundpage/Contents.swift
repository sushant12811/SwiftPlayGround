//MARK: Booleans

/*
 Swift has a basic Boolean type, called Bool. Boolean values are referred to as logical,
 because they can only ever be true orfalse. Swift provides two Boolean constant values,
 true and false:
 */

let youHaveCar = true
let youHaveHouse = false

/*
  It doesnot need to include type as other datatypes.Boolean values are particularly
 useful when you work with conditional statements such as the if statement:
 */

if youHaveCar {
    print("Yes I have a car")
}else{
    print("Sorry, I don't have any car")
}
